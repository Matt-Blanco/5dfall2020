                While the two murals seem similar and on the surface look like they were completed by the same artist 
                they're actually not. The mural on the left was completed in London in 2002 by now famous artist Banksy. 
                While the left mural was completed in 2015 in Boston by French artist Jef Aerosol, and many other stencils 
                done by Jef can be seen throughout Northeastern's campus. It's unmistakable the similarity between the 
                artists as both of their works portray everyday people, and just because it's not a Banksy doesn't mean it 
                shouldn't be celebrated.
